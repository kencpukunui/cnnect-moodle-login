/**Please open the new_signup_form.php to find more detailed informations**/

1. This codes will redirect create new user page to a hook form, but still use the same validation in moodle.

2. There are 3 part need be careful
-> /home/ken/public_html/login/new_signup_form.php (This php file basically copy the existing signup_form.php but done some field customizations for our client)
-> /home/ken/public_html/login/(lib folder)authlib.php (You must copy this file and paste it into this path /home/ken/public_html/lib and rename it to authlib.php in the folder of lib, it will causes a conflict of same file name, you can rename the former authlib.php file to be old_authlib.php and paste this new authlib.php file into the folder as well)
-> /home/ken/public_html/login/signup.php (This php file will call customise functions from authlib.php)


3. If the description above is quietly complex for you, just follow the steps below
(1) copy the new_signup_form.php and paste it into your folder (/home/ken/public_html/login)
(2) copy the (lib folder)authlib.php and go to this path /home/ken/public_html find the authlib.php rename to old_authlib.php then paste the copied file (lib folder)authlib.php and rename it to authlib.php
(3) Go to this path /home/ken/public_html/login/signup.php open the file and rename those function below of 2 lines
| $mform_signup = $authplugin->signup_form(); ==> $mform_signup = $authplugin->signup_hook_form();
| $user = signup_setup_new_user($user); ==> $user = signup_setup_new_user_username_as_email($user);

Step(2) just like replace the original file but keep the former file inside the same folder.

4. How to activate this function?
Go to your moodle site login as Admin's user.
Go to site Administration > Search field > type Manage authentication > Enable the 'Email-based self-registration' > Change the drop-down option to 'Email-based self-registration' of self registration field > Save it > Refresh the page and logout your Admin's account, you will be able to see a new register button display on the signup page
